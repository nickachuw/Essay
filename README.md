**World City Populations (1950-2035)**

Introduction:

The project I chose to look at in more depth was one called World City Populations (1950-2035) found on the website [https://luminocity3d.org/WorldCity/#3/12.00/10.00](https://luminocity3d.org/WorldCity/#3/12.00/10.00). The goal of the project is to show population change over time. More specifically the author mentions that he wants to use this project to show how our world is becoming increasingly urban and how that might raise current and future global societal challenges. When talking about the idea of societal challenges, the author further explains his thoughts, &quot;From global equality to health, education, prosperity and, not least, sustainability, solutions need to be interwoven with fostering liveable, efficient and inclusive cities&quot;. One of the main functions of the project includes using proportional circles representing city populations in the years 1950, 1990, 2015, and 2030. The project highlights the regions in the globe with the most spectacular urban growth along with the time period when the growth occurred. The population circles overlay each other to help visualize the population change of the cities. Additionally, there are time-series graphs and statistics for each individual city when the user hovers over the city. The website includes queries of city statistics, such as highlighting the world&#39;s largest cities in different years. This means data such as a graph of population over time, the population data for the years 1950, 1990, 2015, and 2030, global ranks, and national ranks are displayed when hovered over (see example; below **F1** ). The target audience for the project includes anyone looking to visually understand the explosive growth of cities over the years or anyone studying major city populations and how time has affected them. This most likely could be used by those in an area of research of urban geography, city modeling, and sustainability. ![](RackMultipart20200606-4-zeg1ka_html_569e2ed2f6389ff6.png)

The author is Duncan Smith who is a researcher specializing in urban geography, GIS, visualization, city modeling, and sustainable travel. He is a lecturer at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at University college of London which is also a key contributor for the project. The goal of CASA includes research in cities, city modeling, and smart city applications.

Systematic Architecture:

Unfortunately, the project does not currently support responsive design. When testing the project on an iPhone, the map did not scale down resulting in only some elements appearing on the screen. Any buttons pressed or features highlighting prompts popups to appear however they are large in size and typically take up the whole screen. Additionally, once the popups appear, it is nearly impossible to close it resulting in requiring the user to restart the webpage for it to become functional once again.

Some of the web map elements used include a legend located on the top left corner of the map, and tabs located at the bottom left of the webpage.

_Legend:_

The legend contains the title of the project &quot;World City Populations 1950-2035&quot; along with small circles of different colors with the label &quot;Circle areas proportional to populations in â€“ &quot;. Each color of the 4 circles represents one of the four years that the page is mapping [1950, 1990, 2015, 2035]. Additionally, a link to the data source (United Nations 2018) and to the designers (D.A Smith, CASA, UCL) are included within the legend.

_Tabs:_

There are a number of tabs that are located in the bottom right of the webpage. One of the tabs is labeled &quot;Map Guide&quot; and when clicked on by the user, a lengthy description of the map is shown. This description includes the titles &quot;Urban Transformation&quot; and &quot;Waves of Growth&quot; along with an informative explanation of the topics. Additionally, there are links within this description that lead to other maps and websites that can provide more details on the subject of populations. The designer also included links within this description to certain cities and countries that are located within the map. When the city is clicked on by the user, the map centers to the chosen city/country (see **F2** ).

The other main tab is labeled &quot;Analysis&quot; and when clicked on it displays a smal box in the corner which allows the user to choose a data query from a list. The list contains options for the largest cities in each of the four years (1950, 1990, 2015, 2035), along with highest/lowest absolute growth, and the global and national population totals. When one of these features is clicked on, a table is displayed and the top 12 cities for each category becomes highlighted on the map(See **F3** ). The &quot;Map Guide&quot; and the &quot;Analysis&quot; tabs are able to be minimized once opened to return the map to the original format.

Included next to the other main tabs is a tab in which buttons such as a Facebook &quot;like&quot; link, a Twitter &quot;tweet&quot; button and a share button are included. These are links which lead to different webpages based on which button is pressed.

Strengths &amp; Weaknesses:

One of the weaknesses within the map includes an issue that the author mentions. Since the measurements of city populations depend on where regional boundaries are defined but each individual nation-state uses their own definitions for cities, this makes it hard for the UN (the data source) to produce completely accurate data. Additionally, data is not always available which can lead to population underestimation. Another issue includes the size of the circles for certain regions where there are numerous large cities. This can cause numerous large cities&#39; circles to merge creating a single giant city where there should be multiple. China is a perfect example of this as cities like Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen all are proportionally large cities that are in close proximity to each other thus producing a confusing visually where it is hard to distinguish between the three (see **F4** ).

Many of the strengths include the overall design of the web map. The data is displayed in a visually appealing way and the overall user interface is easy to use. After testing out multiple features of the map there does not appear to be any issues that are faced, and the map is easily navigable. Additionally, the tabs that are included help tie in the key ideas that the map is showing. They help provide a clearer and fuller picture of what the designer is trying to produce along with having certain information such as the top population totals of certain years easily discovered. This prevents the user from having to highlight over each individual country to find such information. The legend is highly informative and helps the user accurately identify the difference in populations across the decades.
